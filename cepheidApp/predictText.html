<h2>Distance Estimator</h2>
<p>Using the linear models obtained from the SMC Cepheid period-magnitude observations as a distance calibration, the distance to Cepheids in other regions of space, eg other galaxies, can be estimated from their observed periods and apparent magnitudes.</p>
To estimate the distance, at least two observable attributes of the Cepheid are required:
<ul>
  <li>The <b>light curve period</b> of the Cepheid</li>
  <li>Either the <b>maximum apparent magnitude</b> of the Cepheid, and/or</li>
  <li>the <b>minimum apparent magnitude</b> of the Cepheid</li>
</ul>
