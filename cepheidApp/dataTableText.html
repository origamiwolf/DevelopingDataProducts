<p>This table shows the 25 stars identified by Leavitt in 1912 as being variable, and whose periods correlate with their magnitudes.</p>
The columns are:
<ul>
<li>H: Harvard number of the star</li>
<li>Epoch: Epoch in days</li>
<li>Period: Period in days</li>
<li>magVal: Maximum or minimum magnitude</li>
<li>appMag: Apparent magnitude of star</li>
<li>absMag: Absolute magnitude of star</li>
</ul>
<p>The first 5 columns are obtained from Leavitt (1912).  The last column is computed from the apparent magnitude of the star and the estimated distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud.</p>
