<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p><b>Introduction Tab</b>: Introduction and Background for this Shiny app.</p>
<p><b>How to Use Tab</b>: This tab.</p>
<p><b>Data Tab</b>: This tab shows the data being used for the Period-Luminosity model.</p>
<p><b>Plot Tab</b>: This tab shows plots of the data.  The appearance of the plot is controlled by the following widgets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance to SMC: This sets the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud.  The computation of the absolute magnitudes is dependent on this variable.  Initial value of 200 kilo light years is obtained from Reference 5.</li>
  <li>Axis Type: Select whether to display x-axis as Period or log<sub>10</sub>Period.</li>
  <li>Display magnitude type: Select whether to display apparent magnitude or absolute magnitude on y-axis.</li>
  <li>Display regression lines: Select whether to display model fits of magnitude vs log<sub>10</sub>Period.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Distance Estimator Tab</b>: In this tab, the model fits shown in the Data tab can be used to estimate the distance to other Cepheids whose period and apparent magnitudes are known.  To perform an estimate, simply input the period of the Cepheid (in days), and either one or both of its apparent magnitude extremes.  From these values, predictions of its absolute magnitudes and distance will be made.
