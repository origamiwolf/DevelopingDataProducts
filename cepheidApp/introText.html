<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many stars in the night sky have been observed to show periodic changes in their brightness over time.  These brightness fluctuations can be due to regular changes within the structure of a star, or alternatively due to external factors such as being eclipsed by a companion star gravitationally bound to it.</p>
<br>
<p>In one class of variable stars, known as Cepheids, there is a strong relationship between the period of the brightness fluctuation, and the luminosity (energy output) of the star.  This relationship, known as the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relationship, was discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who worked at the Harvard College Observatory as one of the women "data processors" tasked to classify and catalogue stars in the observatory's photographic plate collection.  In 1908 Leavitt published a catalogue of nearly 2,000 variable stars observed in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy nearby our own Milky Way galaxy [1].  Upon further study, Leavitt identified a linear relationship between the logarithm of the period, and the magnitude of the Cepheid.  Her results were published in 1912 [2].</p>
<br>
<p>Other astronomers like Hertzsprung [3] and Hubble [4] built upon her work, eventually leading to the use of Cepheids as yardsticks to measure distances in space.  This continues till today, and its accuracy has improved greatly with a modern sensitive light detectors both on Earth and space.</p>
<br>
<p>This Shiny app provides a way of exploring the data and Period-Luminosity Relationship of Cepheids from Leavitt's 1912 paper, as well as a distance estimator based on this model.</p>
